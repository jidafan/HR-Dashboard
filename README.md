### Introduction

The project shown is an HR dashboard that tracks employees at a fictitious company. The dashboard has two views showing an overview of the company and a view that shows information on the specific employees. 

### Code

In the [code](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/Data%20Generation.ipynb), the Python library **Faker** was used to generate the information about the employees at the company. The dataset simulates employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The [data](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/HumanResources.csv) is then exported to a CSV to be analyzed and visualized in Tableau.

### Dashboard

#### Design

Before working on the dashboard, we design the format and layout using draw.io to get a clear view of the dashboard. The [design](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/Dashboard%20HR.drawio.png) can be viewed here.

#### Creation

To create the dashboard, various calculated fields were created for the dashboard and charts showcasing the information such as timelines, heatmaps, bar charts and other charts. To enhance the information, various drill-down features were implemented to provide additional information. To make the dashboard more interactable, filters are presented at the top of each dashboard to allow users to navigate the dashboard. A navigation panel is present on the left side of each dashboard that allows users to navigate through each dashboard, an information button that provides an introduction to the dashboard, buttons to download a pdf/image of the dashboard, and buttons to navigate to social media links.

#### Additioanl Touches

To finish our dashboard, we create a custom background using **Figma** to create shadows and rounded corners to produce a more polished professional look. The [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/scott.duong8287/viz/HRDashboard_17219463577760/HRDashboard) can be viewed here.
