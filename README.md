### Introduction

The project shown is an HR dashboard that tracks employees at a fictitious company. The dashboard has two views showing an overview of the company and a view that shows information on the specific employees. 

### Code

In the [code](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/Data%20Generation.ipynb), the Python library **Faker** was used to generate the information about the employees at the company. The dataset simulates employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The [data](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/HumanResources.csv) is then exported to a CSV to be analyzed and visualized in Tableau.
